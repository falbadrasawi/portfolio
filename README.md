Welcome to my portfolio page. 

I used React to build it, a few libraries to enable to functionality, and deployed it to GH pages. 
This is great because AWS was costing me a fortune lately. 

Everything is functional, so if you send me an email, I will receive it. If you click the image carousel, the images enlarge. Etc. 
This is really nice because I can now easily showcase my projects with this setup and not have to jump through hoops to showcase my work.
