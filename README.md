# Portfolio

Built using React, GH Pages and a few different libraries for functionality. 

Utilitzed a very simple build process using a black background and a terminal-esque font. I'm a big fan of that style and want to keep my theme computer based. 
Navigation is really easy using react router, it works very well with GH pages unlike React Native which was unconfigurable for the platform from my experience but maybe brighter minds have figured it out. 

The about is short sweet and simple, and all pages have header and footer components to easily navigate pgaes and inspect the source code if need be. 

## Project Description and Tasks
